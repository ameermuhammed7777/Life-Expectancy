# Life-Expectancy


Life expectancy is a statistical measure of average time of an organism expect to live

This project aims to predict the life expectancy of various countries using machine learning techniques.The prediction model is developed using a dataset that includes multiple socio-economic and health-related factors,which may influence life expectancy.

In this project,I created a model to predict the life expectancy of different countries using machine learning.I collected data on various factors like GDP,literacy rate and healthcare spending.

I cleaned the data to remove any errors and then used visualizations like scatter plots,heatmaps and box plots to understand how these factors are related to life expectancy.For example,scatter plots helped us see how GDP correlates with life expectancy,while heatmaps showed the correlation between different variables.

Next,I split the data into training and testing sets and tried different machine learning models,such as Multiple Linear Regression,Descission tree and Random Forest.I chose the best-performing model based on accuracy and other evaluation metrics.

Finally,I used visual tools to interpret the model's predictions and to see which factors were most important in determining life expectancy.This project helps to understand what influences life expectancy and how different countries compare.
